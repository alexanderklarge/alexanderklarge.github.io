	<h1>Hi there, I'm Alex.</h1>
	<p>I'm a 24 year old Junior Data Analyst, currently working on a few different <a href='https://www.beeminder.com/alexanderklarge'>projects</a>. I'm interested in data science & machine learning, coding, academic research, the Effective Altruism & LessWrong communities, and quantified-self / self-improvement / personal knowledge management.</p>
	<p>I'm a recent re-discoverer of the Effective Altruism space, and am in the process of teaching myself the skills to go from a data analyst to a data scientist in order to increase my career capital & earning-to-give ability.</p>
	<p>I'm a huge Anki + Beeminder + (recently added) Roam Research advocate and have actually had to force myself to stop bringing them up around friends due to going on about them (especially Anki) too often.</p>
