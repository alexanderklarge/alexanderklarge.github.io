	<h1>Hi there, I'm Alex.</h1>
	<p>I'm a 24 year old Junior Data Analyst, currently working on a few different <a href='https://www.beeminder.com/alexanderklarge'>projects and 'areas of responsibility'</a> (following the <a href='https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/'>PARA system</a>). I'm interested in data science & machine learning, working towards being a generalist coder, academic research, the Effective Altruism movement, and quantified-self / self-improvement / personal knowledge management. The biggest nerd about learning you'll ever meet. Also massively into music.</p>
	
	<p>I'm a huge Anki + Beeminder + Roam Research advocate and have actually had to force myself to stop bringing them up around friends due to going on about them (especially Anki) too much.</p>
